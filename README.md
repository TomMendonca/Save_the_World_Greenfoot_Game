# Cooperative Trash Recycling Game

Save the World is a cooperative trash collection and recycling game developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project using Java and the Greenfoot framework.

## Technical Details

- **Language:** Java
- **Framework:** [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/)
- **Objective:** Apply OOP principles in the development of an interactive and engaging game.

## About the Game

The objective of the game is for players to collect objects representing trash, preventing them from falling behind the wall and becoming inaccessible for collection. After collecting an object, the player must deposit it in the appropriate container for recycling.

### Game Mechanics

- **Objective:** Collect as much trash as possible and recycle it correctly to earn points.
  
- **Cooperative Play:** Both players need to collaborate to succeed in trash recycling.
  
- **Scoring:** Accumulate points based on the number of recycled trash items. Each correctly recycled container earns the player a score of 50 points.

- **Hazards:** Attention: it is crucial to prevent trash from passing the barrier, as this highlights environmental pollution and can result in the loss of life for both players. Additionally, if a player makes the mistake of putting trash in the wrong bin, there will also be a penalty with the loss of life.

- **Life:** Each player starts the game with a full life bar. The game ends when both players run out of lives. The final outcome is determined by the total points accumulated throughout the game.
